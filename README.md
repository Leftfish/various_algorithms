# Various algorithms

This is a quite randomly updated repo with solutions to algorithmic problems.

As of now:
* [Percolation](percolation/percolation.py): a Python implementation of a simulator of percolating systems (with union-find).
* [8 puzzle](8puzzle/8puzzle.py): a Python implementation of a solver of 8-puzzle-like problems (with A* tree search).
* [Maze runner](maze-wall-follower/wallfollower.py): a simple maze-solving script that follows the easiest wall following technique, so works only for simply connected mazes
