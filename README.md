# Various algorithms

This is a quite randomly updated repo with solutions to algorithmic problems.

As of now:
* [Percolation](percolation/percolation.py): This is a Python implementation of a solution to the percolation problem, discussed e.g. in [this Stanford/Coursera course](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)
